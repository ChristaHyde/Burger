Homework Assignment #11

1. If you love burgers then you have come to the right place!
2. When the user lands on my web app, they can add burgers which they would love to devour.
3. Once a burger is added, it goes up to the "Waiting to be Devoured" section of the app.
4. When the user feels like devouring that particular burger waiting then they click on the "Eat It" button and it is then moved to the section of the app titled, "Burgers that have been Devoured"!
5. If the user would rather get rid of that particular burger than eat it, they can click on, "Delete It" and the burger disappears!
6. Since my web app communicates with mySQL database, the user can add and devour as many burgers as they would like!
